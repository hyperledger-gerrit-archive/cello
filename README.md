Cello is a blockchain provision and operational system, which helps provide Blockchain as a Service.

**Note:** This is a **read-only mirror** of the formal [Gerrit](https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/cello) repository. Find more details at [Cello Wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/cello).

## Introduction

Using Cello, everyone can:

* Provision customizable Blockchains instantly, e.g., a Hyperledger fabric network.
* Maintain a pool of running blockchains atop of baremetals, vms, Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.
* Check the system status, scale the chain numbers, change resources... through a dashboard.

Explore more [scenarios](docs/scenario.md).

## Main Features

* Manage the lifecycle of blockchains, e.g., create/delete/keep health automatically.
* Response nearly instantly, even with hundreds of chains, or nodes.
* Support customized (e.g., size, consensus) blockchains request, currently we support [hyperledger fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric).
* Support native Docker host or swarm host as the compute nodes, more supports on the way.
* Support heterogeneous architecture, e.g., Z, Power and X86, from bare-metal servers to virtual machines.
* Extend with monitor/log/health features by employing additional components.

## Documentation

For new users, it is highly recommended to read the [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) first.

Can you find anyone better at playing chains? :)
